-- cpg_time_spine
--
-- One row per calendar day. The semantic layer requires a time spine at DAY
-- granularity or smaller before it will serve any metric that has a time
-- dimension, which every metric in this track does (order_date).
--
-- Without this model, dbt platform commands (including dbt seed, since it
-- validates the semantic manifest before running anything) fail with:
-- "The semantic layer requires a time spine model with granularity DAY or
-- smaller."
--
-- Range is wide on purpose so it comfortably covers the seed data and years
-- of future demo runs without needing to be touched again.
